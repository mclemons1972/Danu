Danu
====

"Danú" new software under development from our group at git hub.
Right now working on some compiling utilities such as a qvm compiler called "QVMBAT"
,and the games source code. It will be an open source game based on id tek 3 source known as the quake engine.
A single player game is under development called "Danú". 
Any contributions are welcome, and I will keep you all posted on the progress. This is just a hobby for me, 
and I will be incorporating Ideas and themes that we discuss in this group into the game graphics and story.
